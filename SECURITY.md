- **Type of issue** (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability**
- **The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)**
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)**
- **Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it**

### What to Expect

- **48 hours**: Initial response to your report
- **7 days**: Status update on the issue
- **30 days**: Target date for resolution (depending on complexity)

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it
- **Do not** use the vulnerability for any purpose other than testing and reporting
- **Do** provide us with reasonable time to respond and fix the issue
- **Do** work with us to coordinate the disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your Python and Node.js dependencies
2. **Use environment variables**: Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys
3. **Secure your AWS credentials**: Use IAM roles and least privilege principles
4. **Enable HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Regular backups**: Keep regular backups of your database
6. **Monitor logs**: Regularly check application and server logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries
3. **XSS prevention**: Sanitize output and use Content Security Policy
4. **CSRF protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
5. **Secure file uploads**: Validate file types and scan for malware
6. **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

## Security Features

The Mortgage Document Processing System includes several security features:

- **Input validation** on all API endpoints
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests
- **Environment variable** configuration for sensitive data
- **File type validation** for document uploads
- **Error handling** that doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Database parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in the changelog.
